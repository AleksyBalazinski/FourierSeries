# FourierSeries
This program demonstates visually what effect has adding more and more terms in Fourier Series (FS) of a given function.
### How to use the program?
First, specify what function you want to represent with FS. This can only be done directly in the program's code and in the place marked by a comment. Then, by clicking space n times you will see n-th term in FS being drawn on the screen. 
### How does it work?
The program calulates *a* and *b* coefficients using a known formula (additional information can be found on the Wikipiedia). This involves integration, which is done using Riemman integral definition, i.e. calculating area under the graph. Then, value of FS for every point between -8 and 8 is calculated and a point is drawn accordingly in this place, together with a line which connects it with a previous one.
